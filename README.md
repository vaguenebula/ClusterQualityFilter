# ClusterQualityFilter

K-Means clustering has been shown to precisely cluster embeddings of semantically and contextually similar text. This can be useful for filtering datasets for quality or undesireable topics. 

This project aims to improve on simply clustering embeddings with K-Means by incoporating various methods:
1. Using cosine similarity instead of euclidean distance as the distance metric
2. Using a ariety of embedding types that capture different features
3. Using multiple clustering algorithms
